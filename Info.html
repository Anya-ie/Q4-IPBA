            <h2>Basic Information about this Typhoon</h2>
            <p>
                Typhoon Super Odette; also known as Typhoon Rai, is recognized as one of the most impactful and severe tropical cyclones. Lasting a handful of 10 days. Specifically during December 12, 2021 up to December 22, 2021. This typhoon striked many well-known countries, namely; Vietnam, Hong Kong, the Southern areas of China, and of course, the Philippines. The particular sector of the Philippines in which this typhoon greatly affected was found to be Southern Visayas (Includes regions like Siargao island, Dinagat Island, and Maasin city), Northern Visayas (Regions like Surigao City was found to be considerably impacted.), and lastly, Cebu Island. The severe typhoon wind traveled at peak speeds of 195 km/h, and a gustiness that is recorded to be 270 km/h. Additionally, as specified by the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa), during the course of the 10 days that the typhoon had traveled, it accumulated 272.1 millimeters of precipitation (rainfall).
                <br>
                <br>The hardest hit areas included Surigao City in Northern Mindanao, Siargao Island, Dinagat Island,Maasin city in southern Visayas, and Cebu island. Around 2,108,858 houses were damaged, with 404,653 destroyed and 1,704,205 partially damaged, resulting in an estimated PHP 17.8 billion worth of crop, livestock, poultry, fisheries, and agricultural facilities damaged. It destroyed farms, houses, and other food sources as it tore through 11 of the 17 regions of the nation. Twelve million people were affected by a massive earthquake in the Caraga region, Southern Leyte, and the islands of Bohol. Landslides caused by tree damage caused significant damage in mountainous areas, affecting tourist attractions, marine resources, and leaving waste clogging roads, rivers, and shorelines.

            <h2>How did our community recover?</h2>
            <p>
                Even with a quick action of the government and civic society, there are still unmet requirements, such as sanitary facilities, food, medicine, repair kits, safe housing, and drinkable water. In the impacted areas, humanitarian assistance was led by the Philippine government. Authorities perhaps put out notices and instructions on safety precautions, and emergency response teams were probably waiting to help anybody in need. A coordinated and successful response to the typhoon would have required cooperation between local officials, relief agencies, and community people. The recovery from Typhoon Odette required an integrated plan that was assisted by government agencies, non-governmental groups, and international humanitarian organizations. This included clearing debris, repairing infrastructure, providing medical care, distributing food, and providing psychiatric support.
